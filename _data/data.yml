      - Switched to IT/security business. 
      - Moved on to big data (the term wasn't coined till much later). 
      - Worked as a political operative (out guy won, but then it all turned to crap).
      - Edited a science & technology magazine. 
      - Dabbled in intellectual property rights, 
      - legal communications. 
      - Spent time as a GR director for a major food corp, helped sell it to Pepsico.
      - Back in IT - facilitated a big face recognition project in a major European airport 
      (customs enforcement).
